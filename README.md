# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, the primary problem was developing a course management system that could efficiently load, store, and retrieve information about various courses, including their titles and prerequisites. This task required selecting appropriate data structures to handle the operations efficiently, such as inserting course data, sorting course lists, and quickly retrieving course information based on user input.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I first considered the importance of data structures in software design. Data structures are crucial because they directly impact the efficiency and performance of an application. For this project, I evaluated several data structures—such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees—to determine which would best handle the requirements of fast data retrieval and easy maintenance.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the project, I encountered several roadblocks, such as managing the correct loading of course data from files and ensuring the program could handle various edge cases, like searching for non-existent courses. To overcome these challenges, I relied on debugging techniques, thorough testing, and revisiting the fundamentals of data structures to choose the most appropriate solution for each problem.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how to select and implement data structures that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the overall scalability and efficiency of the application. Additionally, the iterative process of refining the code helped me appreciate the importance of modular design and the need for writing code that is maintainable and adaptable to future changes.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Moreover, this project has evolved the way I write programs by emphasizing the importance of clear, readable code. I learned that well-organized code, with meaningful variable names and comments, is not just easier to debug but also more adaptable when requirements change. This focus on maintainability and readability will influence how I write and structure my code in future projects, ensuring that it remains easy to understand and modify by others or by myself over time.
